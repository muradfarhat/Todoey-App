Todoey is a simple and intuitive iOS app that helps you manage your daily tasks and stay organized. The app leverages Core Data for data persistence and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

With Todoey, you can create, update, and delete tasks effortlessly. The app provides a user-friendly interface where you can mark tasks as completed. In the latest update, we have added swipe gestures for quick task management. You can now swipe left to delete tasks, swipe right to edit tasks, and swipe to mark tasks as done.

Key Features:

* Create and manage tasks: Add new tasks, update existing ones, and mark tasks as completed.
* Swipe to delete, edit, and mark as done: Effortlessly manage your tasks with intuitive swipe gestures.
* Data persistence with Core Data: All your tasks are securely stored using Core Data, ensuring data persistence across app launches.
* MVVM design pattern: The app follows the MVVM design pattern, separating concerns and providing a scalable architecture.


Technical Details: Todoey is built using Swift, Apple's modern programming language for iOS development. The app utilizes Core Data, Apple's powerful framework for data persistence, to store and manage tasks. The MVVM design pattern is employed to maintain a clear separation between the data model, view, and business logic.

Dependencies:

* CoreData: Used for data persistence and managing the task entities.
* UIKit: Provides the foundation for building the app's user interface.
* Foundation: Supports fundamental data types, such as dates and URLs.
